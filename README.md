### Brief Description
I wanted to create a website to help cancer patients in their journey by simplifying the access of reports, information, and appointments so that the patient can access everything from home.
Moreover, Doctors can record and manage their patients online without the use of physical papers.
The Admin manages the entire website.
More information can be found in the documentation where every user's action is explained in details.
